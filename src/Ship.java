	 *         The position of this ship,according to the y-axis.

	 * @param  radius
	 * 		   The radius of this new ship.
	 * 
	 * @param  xVelocity 
	 *         The velocity of this vessel, in the x-direction.
	 *         
	 * @param  yVelocity 
	 * 		   The velocity of the vessel, in the y-direction. 
	 *         
	 * @param  orientation
	 * 		   The orientation of this vessel, i.e., it's direction.
	 *       
	 * @post   The lowest possible velocity is zero, it can only move forward.
	 * 		  
	 * @post   The lowest possible radius is 10 km. (This minimum can easily be changed).
	 * 
	 * @post   The highest possible speed is 300000 (km/s) it can never exceed this.
	 * 		   digital clock is equal to 23.
	 * 
	 * @post   The orientation of the ship will always be a value between 0(Right) and 2PI(Right).
